*Node.js Web Server*

This repository contains a simple Node.js web server that can be used to serve static files or as the foundation for a more complex web application.
Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/[username]/node-web-server.git

Install the dependencies by running the following command in the root of the project:

    npm install

Start the server by running the following command in the root of the project:

    node server.js

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the server.

Configuration
The server can be configured by modifying the config.js file. The following options are available:

    port: The port number that the server will listen on.
    staticDir: The directory that static files will be served from.

Adding Endpoints

The server can be easily extended to handle different endpoints by adding new routes to the server.js file. Each endpoint should be added as a new route using the app.get() method. For example, to add an endpoint for the root URL, you would add the following code to the server.js file:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

This would make the endpoint respond with "Hello World!" when a user navigates to the root URL in their web browser.

Deployment
To deploy the server to a live environment, you will need to install Node.js on the target machine and then follow the steps in the "Getting Started" section to start the server. Make sure to update the config.js file to match your production environment.

Conclusion
This is a simple node.js web server that can be easily configured and extended to suit your needs. It is a good starting point for building more complex web applications and can be easily deployed to a live environment.
